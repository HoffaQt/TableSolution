# TableSolution
The simulation can be run either by running the "dotnet run" command from the TableSolution/tableapp folder or via Visual Studio.
First command for setting up the table size and starting coordinates has to have all four values without seperators, after the table is setup you can either run multiple commands again with no seperators or every command on its own.
